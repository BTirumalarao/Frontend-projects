<p>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">Konidela Pawan Kalyan(born Konidela Kalyan Kumar; 2 September 1971) is an Indian politician, actor and philanthropist serving as the 11th Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;"> He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development and Rural Water Supply; Environment, Forest, Science and Technology in the Government <br>of Andhra Pradesh and an MLA representing the Pithapuram constituency.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">He is the founder and president of the Janasena Party.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">As an actor, Kalyan is known for his distinctive style and mannerisms in Telugu cinema.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">He enjoys a huge fanbase across the Telugu states, often described as "unfathomable," "fiercely loyal," and akin to a "cult following."</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;"> He is among the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list multiple times since 2012.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;"> He is the recipient of a Filmfare Award and a SIIMA Award among other accolades.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">Kalyan made his acting debut in the 1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">Then, he had a streak of six consecutive hits, among which Tholi Prema (1998), Thammudu (1999), Badri (2000), and Kushi (2001) became back-to-back blockbusters.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">These films established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">In 2001, he became the first ever South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi. Kalyan later faced a slump, yet his popularity kept soaring despite the flops.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">He made a comeback with Jalsa (2008), the highest-grossing Telugu film of that year, and continued with hits like Gabbar Singh (2012),<br> Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Gopala Gopala (2015), and Bheemla Nayak (2022).</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;">He received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Gabbar Singh.</li>
    <li type="1" style="font-size: 20px;"> Both Kushi and Attarintiki Daredi held the record for the highest-grossing Telugu film of its era.</li>
